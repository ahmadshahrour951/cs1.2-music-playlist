This is an assignment to play around with linked lists in its purest form in python using songs and playlists objects as the toys. The Playlist class acts as the relationship manager for the linked list and in this class is where the head pointer is located. It will also manage the relationship between the user and the songs. The Song class acts as the node or the child class that acts as an object of data and points to the next object.
